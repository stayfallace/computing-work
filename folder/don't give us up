"don't give us up, please"

# *_THE START_*

you were not born normal. with a head of black hair and your face so pale, you were the younger version of Snow White. You didn't know anything then. your life was going to be 
_normal_, until the doctor shook his head and told your parents everything : about how you would not be able to return back to normality once you knew, about how you could never be
be the same again. 

your parents looked at each other with worry in their eyes. they knew you would have a hard time coping with life. but they still loved you, they didn’t let you think that you
 were abnormal. you would find out at your own time. you grew up thinking you were a normal child. you thought that at 7 years old, not knowing how to form full sentences 
 was okay. you thought that speaking brokenly was all fine. you thought that not understanding anything your classmates said was usual. truth was, you were born with a 
 mental disorder. they knew that there was a centre nearby, where people were trained to teach children like you slowly, to ease into normalcy and so your parents had hired 
 one of them. her name was eileen lim. 

##*_THE HAPPENING_*

when you first saw eileen, you only stared gaping at her.“mama. dada. who that.” was the only thing you said. she smiled, her grin splitting his face. “you’re so cute! your chubby cheeks!” 
ruffling your hair, he asked “what’s your name?” he asked affectionately, raising his voice to a childish squeak for 9 year old you.“my name. what is my name?” you asked
robotically. behind you, your parents flinched. jeongin smiled softly. “you are ashley. and i am eileen.” “eile en” you repeated slowly, liking the sound of her name. 
“eileen!” you exclaimed happily. 

“yes. and your name is?” 

“ashley.” 

eileen placed a hand on yours. “good girl.” 



-in all the following classes you had with him, you would ask the same thing. 

-“what is my name?” 

-the only thing you remembered was jeongin. 

-every session, he would always explain to you, and teach you new things

-however, you never learnt anything. 

-although jeongin always put on a smile in front of you, when he left the house he would be downcast, frustrated, worried. 

-at home, he would run his hands through his hair, wondering why he accepted this job.

-you were harder to teach than most students, you just never learnt. 

-it was just the first day over and over again.

-jeongin wished he could go back on his word, wished he could turn back time.. 

-he sank onto the couch depressed. 

-why was he giving up so easily? 

-he held a hand over his heart, trying to calm the feelings washing over him. 

-steady, jeongin. he told himself

-he would give you one last shot. 

-and then, if you still didn’t improve.. 



-when he came over to your place the next day, he dragged his feet. 

-when he opened the door, a flying blur rushed at him. 

-”jeongin! it’s you! what’s my name?” you squealed. 

-the moment you said that, his whole world seemed to crash around him. 

-he knew that this was his breaking point. 

-he knelt down in front of you. 

-“today, run free. be free. be happy, y/n” he choked, although he knew you would not understand. 

-“what ? oh today someone call at school me stupid. what is stupid?” you asked inquisitively. 

-that somehow triggered jeongin’s tears, he hugged you tightly around the waist, sobbing so hard your body shook. 

-“y-y/n, you are so strong. you are so so strong. i love you so much y/n. i-i’m sorry, i’m so sorry. y-you are amazing. never forget t-that.” 

-you stared confused at him. 

-for that session, all you did was sit beside each other, curled up, in tears. 



-jeongin went home in the rain, crying. 

-he had explained everything to your parents and they understood. 

-and tomorrow would be the last he ever saw of you. 

-the next day was so bright, it seemed nothing could go wrong. 

-it was as if yesterday had never happened. 

-he knocked on the door, as usual. he stepped into the house, as usual. he took in the scents of the house one last time.

-“you’re okay with this?” he asked, making sure you weren’t near. 

-“yes.” your parents breathed. 

-his heart tearing apart, he did the refund and turned back one last time. he remembered the painting he and you almost destroyed, the mess you had left after eating, everything. 

-pulling his black beanie over his head and wearing his black jacket, he turned to go. 

-“jeongin!” you cried. 

-heart sinking, he turned to face you. 

-he knew if he was to leave, he had to do it now. 



-thunder split the skies. 

-“byebye. stay strong.” he said softly before turning and rushing out into the rain. 

-“jeongin, wait! i remember my name! i remember! where are you going? jeongin! jeongin!” 

-he turned back to look at you over his shoulder once. 



-“my name is y/n.” you whispered.
