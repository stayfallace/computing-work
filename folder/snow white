**Snow White. You've heard Snow White, of course. The tale where Snow White and her beautifully amazing *charming* prince lives happily ever after with her horrid, *wicked* 
stepmother dead? But that's the fake, the sugary, the story only kids hear. You aren't kids, are you? No? Then let me tell you the gruesome, bloody, and disgusting version of it.

Snow White, after her ruby red lips, poreclain white skin and berry bright eyes. I was just cleaning the corridors, minding my own business when I heard her threatening her parents

seeing 端bel get fawned over by the lowly peasants just because she said hello to them in the vilage, I just could'nt take it anymore. I spilled it all to my fellow chambermaid, Bryn.

We screamed. An unknown figure was standing in
